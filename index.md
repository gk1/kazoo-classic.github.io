This is a community supported modification of 2600hz's Kazoo, from version 4.3 as their v5.x version is not likely to be released any time soon and that 4.3 packages are only available for CentOS 7, which is End of Life.

The community has put efforts in to support Kazoo v4.3 on later, in-support operating systems, and add additional functionality.

You can contribute buy joining our Discord or by forking any of our repositories and submitting a pull request.
